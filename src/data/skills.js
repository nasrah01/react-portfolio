  description: "Hello! My name is Nasrah and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2019 when I decided to take a short course with code first girls — turns out putting together an interactive website is very satisfying! Fast-forward to today, and I’ve worked on projects using the latest tech stacks including Typescript, React and Node.js. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences."
